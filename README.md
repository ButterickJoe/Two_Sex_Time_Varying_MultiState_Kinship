# Two_Sex_Time_Varying_MultiState_Kinship

Code to implement a combination of Hall Caswell's formal demography of kinship models: volumes II,III,IV; two-sex, multi-state kinship 
subject to time-varying demographic rates.

As inputs the model needs, separate for males and females

1) Time-dependent and age-specific fertility rates, categorised over distinct stage/states.

2) Time-dependent and age-specific mortality rates, categorised over distinct stage/states.

3) Time-dependent and age-specific probabilities of moving from one stage to another

For now, male
